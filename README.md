# Image-Classification-Using-ResNet
This project involves creating a custom 4-class subset (cat, frog, airplane, car) from the CIFAR-10 dataset. A custom CNN model with a ResNet-style residual block and skip connections was built using PyTorch, achieving an accuracy of 85%.

Cifar_data_classification : Trained on more custom dataset , resulting better accuracy than main.py
