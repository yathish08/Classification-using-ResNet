# Classification-using-ResNet
This project involves creating a custom 4-class subset (cat, frog, airplane, car) from the CIFAR-10 dataset, with 300 train, 100 val, and 100 test examples per class. A custom CNN model with a ResNet-style residual block and skip connections was built using PyTorch, achieving an accuracy of 88%.
